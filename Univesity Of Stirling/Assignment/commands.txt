# Commands that need to be executed before the file runhadoop.sh
#   as this createes the file structure needed

hdfs dfs -mkdir assignment

hdfs dfs -copyFromLocal rating.txt assignment/rating.txt

# Commands that might be useful once the runhadoop.sh file has been executed

hdfs dfs -copyToLocal assignment/results/* results/* 

# The command above copies the result files from the execution of the runhadoop.sh
#   into the local filesystem, as in hdfs the cat command cannot be performed


hdfs dfs -rm assignment/results/*

hds dfs -rmdir assignment/results

# The commands above erases all the content in the results directory and the directory itself.
#   This is needed if we want to execute the runhadoop.sh file again, as the results directory MUST NOT
#   exist
